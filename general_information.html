                Emerging and Rising India.
            </p>

            <h2>The Institute</h2>

            <p>
                SBS Industrial Training Institute is the leading and pioneer Institute formed under skill India campaign
                of honorable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi SBSITI is well known and recognized for its Vocational
                Training standards & linkage with the industries in and around Khandwa district.. It functions under
                Directorate of Vocational Education & Training Department of Higher & Technical Education, MP State
                Govt.
                To inculcate technological skills amongst youth to empower them for gainful employment through technical
                & vocational education; and to enhance productivity industrial sector. By having close interaction with

                inculcate quality skills and competencies among the youth for better employability.
            </p>

            <h2>Reasons to Join SBSITI</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><p>The main aim of SBSITI is to provide employment to weaker sections of the society. Most of the
                    skill training programmes are too costly to afford and lengthy in terms of duration besides
                    requiring higher educational qualifications. Easing these conditions, SBSITI is basically designed
                    to offer skills to those who cannot afford expensive training.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>It caters the need of those who didn't get a chance for higher education. That is the reason that
                        the minimum educational qualification for admissions in ITIs is matric, high school or
                        intermediate.
                        It is also a suitable alternative for those, who are inclined to technical education or who
                        wanted
                        to earn at an early age.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>SBSITI is one of the vocational training institutes in India whose NCVT certificate is recognized
                        throughout world as it is certified by ILO (International Labour Organization). So the workers
                        can
                        apply anywhere globally on the basis of this certificate. In India, government is its being
                        contemplated to make mandatory for industries to employ only the ITI certified workers.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The SBSITIs arrange for the campus interviews of students from different streams. Barring a few
                        students, most of them get selected by the companies.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The syllabus of different trades in ITI is designed keeping in mind the needs of different
                        industries. The students are given accurate and detailed knowledge of the trades where they
                        learn to
                        operate machines, maintain the machines and rectify their defects. The stress is given on the
                        practical training instead of theoretical study. It helps students to grasp the knowledge easily
                        and
                        imbibe it in a more clear way for longer period of time.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Even the timings for study are of eight hours per day in accordance with the factory rules. This
                        way the industries don't have to waste their time and money in training workers. The advantage
                        of this work-based policy is that after completing the training, the students easily get
                        absorbed in the factory atmosphere and are more productive.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Every batch consists of 16 to 21 students only, thus, guarantee the students to receive full
                        attention during training.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>One more reason that makes ITI successful is that the medium of teaching is optional and the
                        student could take the exam in either English or Hindi. As English is not our mother tongue,
                        many people face difficulty in expressing themselves in this language. Thus, the language
                        barrier doesn't impede the growth of students in ITI's. What matters here the most is the skill
                        of the person.</p>
